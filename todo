Credits on game completion

Improvements:
telegraph that you can't attack the jellyfish (maybe a little sign with a circle and a cross going through a picture of the lizard bashing the jelly)

After Jam:
Aiming for 30 minutes developer playtime, developer playtime is currently 4 minutes so 30/4 = 7.5 so create ~ 7 levels per existing level, or 60-70 levels total
Make 4 levels a day for 2 weeks (Goal)
Make mobile controls simulate joystick instead of simulating arrow keys
make end screen more satisfying
