TO FINISH THE GAME:
- Ending screen
- Title logo during title drop scene
- Connecting levels for those early levels where you don't exit the previous level the same direction you enter the next level
Improvements:
fix the oxygen resetting to 0 then not replenishing glitch (maybe change it to a repeating tween that subtracts 1 from the amount instead of a big tween that resets it to 0)
telegraph that you can't attack the jellyfish (maybe a little sign with a circle and a cross going through a picture of the lizard bashing the jelly)
add collision squares to places where we've seen the clipping occur
Enemy ideas:
-(done) Pirahna that spins around and attacks you when you are in it's direct line of sight
-(done)Spiky urchin that is stationary but damages you if you touch it (more of an obstacle than an enemy)
-(done)Pirahna that is spiky and shoots a spike at you when you are in it's line of sight
-Jellyfish (tops are harmless, spines on the bottom will hurt you)
-Final boss is an anglerfish
-Anglerfish boss triggers escape sequence from kraken
