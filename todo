too many lights is slowing down the game, don't give each urchin it's own light and instead have a seperate light object to light up a few at a time. Also make the lights of a defeated enemy disapear. (During the "Pirahna Swarm" scene, manually stop the pirahnas from making their lights and have a big light in the scene instead)

Enemy ideas:
-(done) Pirahna that spins around and attacks you when you are in it's direct line of sight
-(done)Spiky urchin that is stationary but damages you if you touch it (more of an obstacle than an enemy)
-(done)Pirahna that is spiky and shoots a spike at you when you are in it's line of sight
-Jellyfish (tops are harmless, spines on the bottom will hurt you)
-Final boss is an anglerfish
-Anglerfish boss triggers escape sequence from kraken
