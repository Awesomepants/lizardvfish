TO FINISH THE GAME:
- Ending screen
- SOUND EFFECTS
- Fix the loader to be less redundant
- DO SOMETHING ABOUT CLIPPING
Improvements:
Find out why Chase level runs so slow
fix the oxygen resetting to 0 then not replenishing glitch (maybe change it to a repeating tween that subtracts 1 from the amount instead of a big tween that resets it to 0)
telegraph that you can't attack the jellyfish (maybe a little sign with a circle and a cross going through a picture of the lizard bashing the jelly)
add collision squares to places where we've seen the clipping occur
